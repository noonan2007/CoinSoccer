		<b>Applying a shot</b>
        <br /><br />
        The game takes place in rounds. The pawns of currently active player get highlighted. 
        In order to select a highlighted pawn simply touch it with finger and fo not raise up. 
        Then drag the finger in the appriopriate direction to define force and direction of the shot. 
        After the force and direction are prepared raise up the finger.
        <br /><br /><br />
        
    	<b>Cancelling a shot</b> 
    	<br /><br />
        In order to cancel a shot, after a pawn has been selected move finger to the center of
        the pawn (as if defining minimal force of shot). This should show a toast message with a trash bin. 
		Raising up the finger up while this toast message is on the screen releases pawn selection.
		After that you can select another pawn from the active team.

        <b>General information</b>
        <br /><br />
		Two users play a soccer-like match with coins placed on a table board. 
		The game takes place in rounds. Each user controls a team of 6 coin pawns which represent 
		football players. There is on additional coin which represents a ball. The coins are placed 
		on a table which represents a soccer pitch (limited with borders made of pencils, as well 
		as with goal symbols). The user applies a shot (force vector) to one of the coins in his team. 
		The aim of each team is (as in a \“normal\” soccer game) to shoot more goals than the opposite 
		team.
		<br /><br />
		This game in \“its physical version\” (played with real coins or bottle nuts on a real table) 
		is quite popular in Central Europe under different names and with slightly modified rules 
		(especially as to fouls and team size) and probably most popular in the Czech Republic, where 
		it is known as the \“table-hockey\”.
		<br /><br /><br />
        
        <b>Illegal situations</b>
        <br /><br />
        - User must not hit a pawn from the opposite team before hitting the ball pawn. 
        This situation is treated as offensive foul and causes reverting state of all pawns to the 
        state as it was before the shot. 
        <br /><br />
        - User must not have more than one pawn in his own goal area. The \"goalie\" pawn must not be 
        inside the goal unless ball is in the goal area. If one of these situation happens the pawns
        in illegal positions are moved to the closest legal positions. Checking for illegal position 
        of pawns is performed after the shot is finished and it applies only to active player\'s pawns.   
        <br /><br />

        <b>Starting A New Game</b>
        <br /><br />
        The game is played by two players. Each player can control his pawns using his
        own device (this is called a <i>remote game</i>) or both players can use the 
        same device for contralling their players (this is called <i>local game</i>).
        <br /><br /><br />
        
        <b>Local Game</b>

        <br /><br /><br />
        
        <b>Remote Game</b>
        <br /><br />
        Remote game is set up on two devices in a different way.
        One device called a <i>host</i> defines settings of the game as well as settings of the first player.
        After that it waits untill another device joins the game with settings of the second player defined.
        This second device is called a <i>guest</i>.
        <br /><br />
        
        In order to start a remote game as a <i>host</i>:<br />
        1) Click <i>New Game</i> button from the main menu screen. You will be redirected to the <i>"Start New Game"</i> screen.<br />
        2) In the <i>Start New Game</i> screen check in <i>Remote</i> checkbox in the second player\'s settings.<br />
        3) Wait untill a <i>guest</i> device requests accepting its player as the second player.<br />
        4) Accept a request mentioned in point 3) or reject if you want to wait for anotjer player.
        <br /><br />
        
        In order to join a remote game as a <i>guest</i>:<br />
        1) Click <i>Join Game</i> button from the main menu screen. You will be redirected to the <i>Join Remote Game</i> screen.<br />
        2) In the <i>Join Remote Game</i> wait untill the available <i>host</i> device appear in a list.<br />
        3) Select the remote game host, you want to join, from the list.<br />
        4) If the remote accepts your player the game starts.<br />
        <br /><br />
